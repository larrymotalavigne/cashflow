## Event Balance Review

**Current Event Amounts**: -3,500€ to +10,000€

### Issues:
1. Some negative events are too severe relative to salaries
2. Positive events (lottery 10,000€) are too rare but too impactful
3. Need better scaling with player's financial situation

### Recommended Adjustments:
- Small events: -500€ to +1,000€ (frequent)
- Medium events: -1,500€ to +3,000€ (occasional)
- Large events: -3,000€ to +5,000€ (rare)
- Very large events: +10,000€ (very rare, ~2% chance)

- Reduce frequency of extreme events

### Priority 3 (Nice to have):
