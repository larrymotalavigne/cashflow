# Junie Guidelines for Httpy Project

## Overview

This document outlines the guidelines for using Junie, our task management approach, for the GoToGym project. These guidelines ensure consistent task tracking, progress reporting, and collaboration among team members.

All the *.md files in `docs/` directory contribute information about building the application.

## Task Management Process

### Using the Task List

1. All project tasks are documented in `docs/tasks.md`
2. Each task has a checkbox that indicates its completion status:
    - `[ ]` - Task not started or in progress
    - `[x]` - Task completed

3. Tasks are organized hierarchically by project area and component
4. Follow the numbered sequence within each section for optimal development flow

### Task Workflow

1. **Task Selection**:
    - Choose tasks based on the current sprint priorities
    - Consider dependencies between tasks (indicated in the task list)
    - Assign tasks to team members based on expertise and availability

2. **Task Execution**:
    - Update the task status to in-progress by adding a comment with your name
    - Follow the technical specifications outlined in the improvement plan
    - Commit code regularly with references to the task number

3. **Task Completion**:
    - Mark tasks as complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in the task list
    - Submit a pull request with the completed task
    - Include test results or demonstration of functionality
    - Update the task list in the main branch after approval
