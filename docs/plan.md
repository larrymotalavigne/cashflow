   - [ ] Add help/tutorial for new players

2. **Main Game Screen**
   - [x] Design and implement player information display
   - [x] Create financial status dashboard
   - [x] Implement turn progression controls
   - [ ] Add responsive layout for different devices
   - [ ] Create animations for financial changes

3. **Investment Interface**
   - [x] Create investment listing component
   - [x] Implement investment details display
   - [x] Add purchase options (cash/loan)
   - [ ] Create investment filtering and sorting
   - [ ] Add investment comparison tools

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - [x] Implement progress chart component
   - [ ] Create financial history visualization
   - [ ] Add milestone achievements
   - [ ] Implement statistics dashboard

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

   - [ ] Perform usability testing
   - [ ] Conduct performance optimization

2. **Game Balance**
   - [ ] Analyze game progression difficulty
   - [ ] Balance investment returns and costs
   - [ ] Adjust random event impact
   - [ ] Fine-tune loan interest rates

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - [ ] Add tooltips and help text
   - [ ] Implement onboarding tutorial
   - [ ] Create visual feedback for actions
   - [ ] Add sound effects and music

### Phase 5: Deployment and Future Development

1. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Prepare production build
   - [ ] Set up hosting environment
   - [ ] Configure analytics tracking
   - [ ] Create deployment pipeline

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Complete user documentation
   - [ ] Create developer documentation
   - [ ] Document API and data structures
   - [ ] Prepare maintenance guide

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - [ ] Plan for difficulty levels
   - [ ] Design economic cycles feature
   - [ ] Outline multiplayer capabilities
   - [ ] Research educational content integration

## Task Dependencies

- Player Management must be completed before Investment System
- Core Data Models must be completed before Game Mechanics Implementation
- Basic Services must be completed before User Interface Development
- Game Mechanics Implementation must be substantially complete before Testing and Refinement

## Resource Allocation

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Angular component development
   - UI/UX implementation
   - Responsive design

2. **Game Logic Development**
   - Financial calculations
   - Game progression logic
   - Random event system

3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Unit and integration testing
   - Game balance testing
   - Performance optimization

## Timeline Estimates

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 1 week

Total estimated development time: 7-11 weeks

## Success Criteria

1. Players can progress from employment to financial freedom through strategic decisions
2. Game mechanics accurately reflect basic financial principles
3. User interface is intuitive and engaging
4. Game is balanced to provide appropriate challenge and reward
5. Application performs well across different devices and browsers
